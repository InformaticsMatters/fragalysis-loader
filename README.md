# fragalysis-loader
Django backend loader for fragalysis app - takes data from Verne and pushes it to fragalysis, and does some processing to add things to the database

# For fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk
- Jenkins builds the loader container 
- Once built, the loader looks for data on verne (the machine that we call the cloud)
   
The loader takes the data and:
- Populates the database
- Does some sciency stuff

# How it works

Nobody knows...
